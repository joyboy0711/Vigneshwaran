      <p>From my childhood I was brainwash to became a priest. So, that environment decided what I have to do and upto age of 22 I really doesn't want to do anything(I had no Passion). Everything changed when I experienced death of my fav person. After that Netgeo Show brain games show me who I am and who we are. That's when I get extremly curious about human brain, science and sath. I started to question everything and realised I want to do more even if it look like childish and CA looks why??? to me. I still decided to complete CA in the process I am understanding the "process of learning"(effective way to learn anything). I realized I didn't know most of the things in the world. Currently in the process of learning things which is curious to me.</p>
